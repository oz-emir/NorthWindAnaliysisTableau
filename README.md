1st Dashboard:

•	I create two KPI Net Sales and Net Sales after Freight to demonstrate total Sales amount. 

•	I create a Donut chart with a year filter to demonstrate what is the percentage of sales made by each employee.

•	I create a TreeMap chart with a new measure to demonstrate wich employee is successful or not.

•	And purpose table chart with horizontal bars is show each category best and worst seller.

According my first dashboard owner of the company can decide which employee to keep and which employee to fire and owner can decide which employee should sell what.

2nd Dashboard:
•	I create two KPI to show Total order have been placed and Count of customer.

•	I create a circle chart with top 10 parameter to demonstrate most successful 10 company.

•	I create a horizontal bar chart to show which category making profit or loss.

•	And create two small charts to show top 3 of category and product.

According my second dashboard owner of this company can decide which companies are top so owner will now relationship between companies. And owner can see which category making profit or loss so owner can decide where to put money or not investment anymore.
